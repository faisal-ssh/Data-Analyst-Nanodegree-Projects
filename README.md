# Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Projects
Use statistics to uncover insights, communicate critical findings, and create data-driven solutions with Python

## Project 1 - Explore Weather Trends
Analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends by extracting the data from the 
database, creating a line chart to compare your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures, and making observations about the similarities and differences between 
the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends.
