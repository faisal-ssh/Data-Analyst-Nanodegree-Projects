# Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Projects
Use statistics to uncover insights, communicate critical findings, and create data-driven solutions with Python

## Project 1 - Explore Weather Trends
Analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends by extracting the data from the 
database, creating a line chart to compare your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures, and making observations about the similarities and differences between 
the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends.

## Project 2 - Investigate a Dataset
Analyze a dataset and then communicate findings about it using Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make analysis easier.

## Project 3 - Analyze A/B Test Results
The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's 
product. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their 
decision.
